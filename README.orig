fracdiff Maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters of a fractionally
         differenced ARIMA (p,d,q) model. For long-memory dependence in 
         time series. (Haslett and Raftery, Applied Statistics 38, 1989, 1-50).

This submission contains the following files :

fracdiff.q          S-functions fracdiff, fracdiff.var, and fracdiff.sim
                   (source("fracdiff.q"))
fdcore.f            Fortran code that differs from the all-Fortran version
fdhess.f            subroutines for computing Hessian and variance information
fdmin.f             auxiliary subroutines from MINPACK
fdgam.f             auxiliary subroutines for the gamma function
Makefile            sample UNIX Makefile for loading into S-Plus
fracdiff.help       help file for the S version (.Data/.Help/fracdiff)
fracdiff.var.help   help file for variance estimation
fracdiff.sim.help   help file for the S version (.Data/.Help/fracdiff.sim)

This is the S-driven version of the Fortan program. Fortran files must be
compiled and loaded into S. In addition to the S function "fracdiff", file 
fracdiff.q includes two other S functions : "fracdiff.var" which allows users 
to change the finite-difference interval for estimating varinaces , and 
"fracdiff.sim" for generating test series.

For dynamic loading you may need to use dyn.load2() with the size option
rather than dyn.load(). Check the size of fracdiff.o to make sure you allow
enough space. On some machines (e.g. Vax 3200 and 5200) you may need to use
static rather than dynamic loading.

If you have Splus (version 3.1 or later), this function is available under
the name "arima.fracdiff".
